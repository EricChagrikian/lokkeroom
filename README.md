# Lokkeroom

#### **In the context of a training task for BeCode,**
I had to make an API that would only return JSON and on which users could: 

**- Register and login,**

**- Create a message lobby for which the creator would be the admin of,**

**- Be added or removed from a lobby, aswell as to be a member of multiple lobbies,**

**- To view and send messages from the lobby they are added to,**

**- To edit and delete their own messages, with the admin being allowed to delete other users messages.**

All of it has been deployed on Heroku with the link: https://lokkeroomeric.herokuapp.com/
